# Learn Go with tests

As one of my new year's resolutions I decided to learn Golang.
I got a really nice recommendation from a friend to use the project [Learning go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
as an initial learning source as it not only teaches you in a practical way, but also is structured using TDD.

I decided to document my journey on this repository by using small incremental commits for each one of the exercises that the project requests.
I will also be writing articles on my [Digital garden](https://www.rodsantos.dev) once I get enough knowledge about the language,
similar to what I did with Kubernetes and Terraform.
